# âœ¨ Personal Site

This is my personal website. Built with coffee and hard work, but also the generosity of [Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0). I appreciate him allowing me to use his source code as the jumping off point for this website. Thanks, Jacky!

Built with [lite.css](https://github.com/jackyzha0/lite.css), Hugo, and plain HTML/JS/CSS.
