## The personal page. Also known as: The mindless meandering musings of a madman.

Some things I am interested in and want to talk about. Would be cool if you read them :)

### Reading
Since I was very young child, some of my best memories have involved books. Whether it be cuddling up next to a sunny window in my childhood bedroom, or walking to Finch Public Library with my parents to sign out books for summer reading, I can owe a great deal of my formative years to the captivating enthrall of novels and novella. While life has changed my priorities for the time-being, I will never not have a book I'm currently reading. 

Currently Reading
* **The Phoenix Project** by Gene Kim

Some of my past favourites
* **The Goal** by Eliyahu Goldratt
* **Neuromancer** by William Gibson
* **The 4-hour work week** by Tim Ferriss

See my [Full Booklist](/books) for further details, reviews, and recommendations.

### Music
Truly, music is the universal language of mankind. There is no substitute for a good album or playlist in those times where you just want to *feel*. Feel good or feel bad, feel happy or feel sad, music is the fastest way to get there.

Current Rotation
* **Since I Left You** by The Avalanches
* **Metaphorical Music** by Nujabes (RIP)
* **Poptical** by Ed Motta

See my [Rate Your Music](https://rateyourmusic.com/~yuvimon) account for more information about my tastes and album & track ratings.

### Weightlifting
Weightlifting is something that I've always been enthralled by, but not something I've always had the ability to do. I remember reading Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder cover to cover *twice* as a child, but never going anywhere with it. (I was 8- sue me). As time has gone on, however, I truly have become a weightlifter in every sense of the word. There's almost nothing as satisfying as picking something *reallllly* heavy up, then putting it back down. Don't believe me? Ask me and I'll show you- Let's go work out together!

Deadlift: 245lb
Benchpress: 155lb
Squat: 155lb

Total: 555lbs

Progress to 1000lb club: 55.5%

### Sports
Someone remind me to write about Tennis and Shooting in here at some point

### Gaming
Last but *definitely* not least, this is the hobby that has captured so much of my teenage years, gaming. I'm not going to wax poetic about this, because it's 2am, but I just want to say: Gaming rocks xd

Here's a random smattering of games i've enjoyed over the years:

* **Counter Strike: Global Offensive:** ~2500 hours
* **Overwatch** ~200 hours
* **The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt:** ~170 hours
* **Borderlands 2** ~60 hours
* **Hotline Miami** ~15 hours

(Not exhaustive in the least)
